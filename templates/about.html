               <h4 class="mb-4">
                  We’re a Australian based escrow company helping businesses and individuals move funds, products &
                  property in a secure, simple way.
               </h4>
               <p class="mb-3">
                  When using an Escrow Service provider, we understand that it’s
                  important to make sure you trust the Escrow Company you’ve
                  chosen. At FTX Express we have taken multiple steps to provide
                  peace of mind for all our customers.
               </p>
               <h4>How are we Regulated?</h4>
               <p class="mb-3">
                  FTX Express is reigistered in Australia with ACN 657907894. FTX
                  Express is authorised by ASIC under The Payment Systems
                  (Regulation) Act 1998 with registration number 81777620 for the
                  provision of payment services. Please note that our
                  authorisation with the Australian Securities & Investment
                  Commission (ASIC) applies only in relation to payment services
                  transactions.
               </p>
               <h4>Where are my Funds kept?</h4>
               <p class="mb-3">
                  FTX Express bank with one of Australias leading banks. We have
                  declared a trust over our dedicated client escrow bank account.
                  <br />
                  The fact we operate a client account means that client funds are
                  segregated from our own funds, and the trust adds additional
                  peace of mind. Your money held by FTX Express would be safe even
                  if FTX Express were to become insolvent, as the insolvency
                  practitioners could not distribute client money to pay for debts
                  of the business, as the trust segregates them.
               </p>

               <h4>What identity checks do we carry out?</h4>
               <p class="mb-3">
                  FTX Express’ Know Your Customer (KYC) program ensures the safety of all transactions by confirming
                  customer identity through documentation collection.
                  To confirm your personal details and address, you must upload a valid proof of identity and proof of
                  address document. This could be a government ID if it adequately verifies your identity and address.
