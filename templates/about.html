                        When using an Escrow Service provider, we understand that it’s important to make sure you trust the Escrow Company you’ve chosen. At FTX Express we have taken multiple steps to provide peace of mind for all our customers.

                        How are we Regulated?
                     </h3>
                     <p class="mb-3">
                        FTX Express is reigistered in Australia with ACN 657907894. FTX Express is authorised by ASIC under The Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 with registration number 81777620 for the provision of payment services.
                        Please note that our authorisation with the Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) applies only in relation to payment services transactions.

                        Where are my Funds kept?

                        FTX Express bank with one of Australias leading banks. We have declared a trust over our dedicated client escrow bank account. <br />
                        The fact we operate a client account means that client funds are segregated from our own funds, and the trust adds additional peace of mind. Your money held by FTX Express would be safe even if FTX Express were to become insolvent, as the insolvency practitioners could not distribute client money to pay for debts of the business, as the trust segregates them. 
                     </p>
                     <h3 class="text-green mb-2 fw-bold">
                        What identity checks do we carry out?
                     </h3>
                     <p class="mb-3">
                        When setting up an escrow account we carry out ‘Know your Client’ (KYC) checks / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks on all parties involved in the escrow transaction. This is a requirement of our regulator. <br />
                        We will require Photographic Identification and proof of address, and may also ask for information regarding the source of funds being used for the transaction and source of wealth, from each of the involved individuals. Identity will also be verified whether in person, over the phone or via photos. It may be that one or more of the parties are Companies, in which case we will ask for KYC documents from one or more of the directors and shareholders.
                     </p>
